# PRD Walkthrough: AI Professional Headshot Generator

## 1) Executive Readout

The PRD defines a strong market-facing concept with clear user value: **high-quality professional headshots at lower cost and faster turnaround than traditional photography**. It includes the right core pillars (upload guidance, generation, style controls, package pricing, privacy, and delivery).

From a build perspective, this PRD is a good **business-level baseline**, but it still needs a few engineering-grade clarifications before implementation:

- measurable SLAs (generation latency by tier),
- acceptance criteria for image quality and identity fidelity,
- explicit data retention and deletion controls,
- payment and entitlement logic,
- re-generation/refund policy flow,
- observability and operational metrics.

---

## 2) Requirement Quality Assessment

## What is already strong

- **Clear target users** (individual professionals + teams).
- **Simple value proposition** that aligns with willingness to pay.
- **Good user flow** from upload to delivery.
- **Feature decomposition** into core vs. should-have vs. nice-to-have.
- **Roadmap phasing** (MVP -> enhancements -> growth).

## What needs tightening before build

1. **Input quality constraints**
   - Minimum/maximum number of selfies.
   - Accepted formats and file size limits.
   - Quality gates (blur, occlusion, face angle, lighting checks).

2. **Generation spec**
   - Required output resolutions and aspect ratios.
   - Number of outputs per style per tier.
   - Maximum generation retries included in each package.

3. **Identity consistency standard**
   - Define what “looks like me” means operationally.
   - Create objective pass/fail thresholds and manual fallback paths.

4. **Retention and deletion behavior**
   - Explicit timer starts (upload timestamp vs. job completion).
   - User-triggered delete flow and confirmation guarantees.
   - Backup deletion policy and legal hold exceptions.

5. **Commercial logic**
   - Checkout model (one-time package, add-ons, upsell timing).
   - Refund policy criteria and automated handling rules.
   - Team billing seats / bundle mechanics.

6. **Operational readiness**
   - Queueing strategy for burst traffic.
   - Failure handling and user notifications.
   - Internal admin tooling for support and moderation.

## 3) Recommended MVP Scope (Phase 1)

To ship quickly while preserving value, keep MVP constrained to the smallest end-to-end paid workflow.

## In scope

1. Authentication (email + password or social login).
2. Guided photo upload with automatic quality checks.
3. Style preset selection (3–5 presets max).
4. Package purchase (Basic + Professional at launch).
5. Generation pipeline with async job status tracking.
6. Results gallery + bulk download.
7. Retention controls and self-serve deletion.
8. Basic support flow (report issue / request re-run).

## Explicitly out of scope for MVP

- Fine-grained editing tools.
- Team workspace and centralized billing.
- API and white-label offerings.
- Advanced branding add-ons (email signature, team page builder).

---

## 4) MVP Functional Requirements (Implementation-Ready)

## FR-1 Upload

- User can upload 8–20 input selfies.
- Allowed types: JPG/PNG/HEIC.
- Client + server validation for:
  - face presence,
  - sharpness,
  - lighting sufficiency,
  - head visibility.
- System blocks submission when minimum quality threshold is not met.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Submission without the minimum valid photos is impossible.
- User sees actionable guidance for each rejected image.

## FR-2 Package and Checkout

- User selects plan before generation starts.
- Payment authorization must succeed before enqueueing generation.
- Entitlements define output count, styles, and priority.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Failed payment never creates generation jobs.
- Entitlement limits are enforced server-side.

## FR-3 Generation Job

- Job lifecycle: `queued -> processing -> completed | failed`.
- User dashboard shows live status and ETA band.
- On completion, assets are attached to the order and indexed by style.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Job status transitions are persistent and auditable.
- User receives completion email + in-app notification.

## FR-4 Results and Download

- User can preview images in gallery.
- Single and bulk download available.
- Download links require authenticated access and expire.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Image access control prevents cross-account access.
- Expired links can be regenerated by owner.

## FR-5 Privacy & Deletion

- Input images auto-delete after configured TTL (default: 7 days).
- Generated images auto-delete after configured TTL (default: 30 days).
- User can delete both immediately from dashboard.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Deletion requests complete within a stated SLA (e.g., < 15 min).
- User sees deletion status and confirmation timestamp.

---

## 5) Non-Functional Requirements (Proposed Targets)

- **Performance**
  - 95th percentile end-to-end generation:
    - Basic: <= 3 hours
    - Professional: <= 90 minutes

- **Scalability**
  - Support 10k daily active users with queue-based horizontal scaling.

- **Availability**
  - Dashboard/API uptime target: 99.9% monthly.

- **Security**
  - Encryption in transit (TLS) and at rest.
  - Signed object URLs.
  - Least-privilege access for model and storage services.

- **Privacy/Compliance**
  - Clear consent and ownership terms.
  - Data retention policy visible pre-purchase.
  - Audit logs for delete operations.

---

## 6) Suggested System Design (High Level)

## Core services

1. **Web App / API Gateway**
   - Auth, dashboard, checkout, order management.

2. **Upload Service**
   - Secure direct-to-object-storage uploads.
   - Validation metadata extraction.

3. **Quality Check Service**
   - Face and image quality scoring.
   - Returns pass/fail + reasons.

4. **Generation Orchestrator**
   - Creates job manifests from package + style settings.
   - Dispatches to model workers through queue.

5. **Model Worker Pool**
   - Runs inference/generation pipeline.
   - Stores outputs and emits progress events.

6. **Asset Service**
   - Thumbnailing, preview generation, signed downloads.

7. **Notification Service**
   - Email and in-app completion/failure updates.

8. **Data Retention Worker**
   - Scheduled purge of expired inputs/outputs.

## 7) Data Model (Minimum Entities)

- `User`
- `Order`
- `Package`
- `UploadAsset` (input selfies)
- `GenerationJob`
- `GeneratedAsset` (results)
- `Entitlement`
- `DeletionRequest`
- `RefundRequest`
- `AuditEvent`

---

## 8) Priority Backlog (Now / Next / Later)

## Now (MVP)

- Auth + dashboard shell.
- Upload with quality checks.
- Basic package checkout.
- Async generation + status tracking.
- Result gallery + download.
- Retention + delete controls.

## Next (Phase 2)

- Edit credits / controlled re-generation.
- LinkedIn/email preview mock frames.
- Team bundles + seat management.
- Improved retry and support tooling.

## Later (Phase 3)

- Public API for external platforms.
- White-label partner mode.
- Native mobile app.

---

## 9) Risks and Mitigations

1. **Identity mismatch dissatisfaction**
   - Mitigation: stricter input guidance + quality gates + rerun credits.

2. **Long queue times during demand spikes**
   - Mitigation: priority queues by plan + autoscaling workers.

3. **Privacy trust concerns**
   - Mitigation: transparent deletion controls and proof of deletion timestamps.

4. **Refund pressure from perceived quality variance**
   - Mitigation: expectation-setting previews, style examples, and explicit satisfaction policy.

---

## 10) KPI Framework

Track weekly and by pricing tier:

- Upload completion rate.
- Upload-to-paid conversion.
- P95 generation completion time.
- Download completion rate.
- Support tickets per 100 orders.
- Refund rate.
- Re-run credit usage.
- 30-day repeat purchase rate.

---

## 11) Final Build Recommendation

Treat the provided PRD as the **product narrative** and this walkthrough as the **delivery bridge**.

The best next execution move:

1. Freeze MVP scope,
2. Convert FRs into tickets with acceptance criteria,
3. Set SLO/SLA targets before implementation,
4. Launch with two paid tiers + strong privacy UX,
5. Use KPI feedback to unlock Phase 2.
